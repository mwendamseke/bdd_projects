http://github.com/emmapersky/one-click-orgs/issues#issue/118 "Update induction process to use interface closer to core app"
See "One Click Orgs v1.0 Requirements" on Google Docs for functional spec.

A new organisation is in a "pending" state until the founder marks it as "complete".
In this state:
- the founder can modify the organisation/consitution without making proposals
- the founder can add new founding members without making proposals
- there is a prominent message that highlights this, and a button to finalise
- founding members can log in and view the consitution, but cannot make changes

Once the founder marks the organisation as "complete":
- Changes now require a proposal
- Members have full access to the system

http://github.com/emmapersky/one-click-orgs/issues/#issue/58 "Multi-org templating: allow the one codebase to support multiple types of organisation"

tbd. 

(For now let's do a quick implementation of #118 and use this to highlight more
detailed requirements for #58.)


 =====================
 = Induction Process =
 =====================

Member class: "founder"
Founder has all possible perms
Founder has new perm: "make changes without proposal"
Founder has new perm: "create proposal to found org"

Member class: "founding member"
Founding member has only one, new perm: "vote on 'found org' proposal"

new banner: "pending org" message, and "found org now" button
-> Confirmation dialogue
- create 'found org' proposal
- migrate founder to 'founding member' class' to prevent org changes

when 'found org' proposal failed:
- founding members can log in, view the constitution, will see a 'founding vote failed' message

when 'found org' proposal succeeded:
- all founding members who voted 'yes' or who abstained (including the founder) get migrated to full 'member' status
- all other founding members receive an email 'sorry that you don't want to be a part of this'
  - do we need/want to disable these accounts?

CURRENT STATE

DONE
* code cleanup of misc controller clause setters/getters
  * co.clauses.get_current||new, set, save!  -> co.clauses.set_text
* new simple induction: one form for founder and org
* new proposal to found org
* new perm and before_filter: found_organisation_permission
* new state and before_filter: organisation_pending
* various controller/model/view changes for the above
* fixed misc typos
* reorganise induction process according to spec
* ...?

IN PROGRESS 
* check latest 1.0 spec and verify our wording, workflow, etc is according to spec
* single-org mode: should probably ask for login post-signup. OR: don't ask for login after signup in multi-org mode
* update unit tests before proceeding! (throw away old ones, write new ones)
  * all induction tests still need to be written
* try logging in as founding member (not founder) during pending org, proposed org, active org
* setup form for (org, founder)
  * should write some tests for OrganisationsController#create, and the org/member/member_class/constitution models
  * should fix broken tests (esp. where code was removed)
  * How can we validate Member.password? it's accepted as form value, but actually saved as crypted_password
* BUG: after creating an org, re-visiting /organisations/new to create the next one leads to a NPE which can be resolved by destroying the current session. -> what's the best fix?
* pending stage & transition
  * should use different wording for "direct edit" forms
  * foundation: should link to founding proposal in header 
  * if founding fails: allow to retry (banner button: "start again", which resets some/all of the existing state. maybe just the org state.)
  * ensure we're sending email: 
    * adding a new member
    * proposing the org
    * activating/failing the org 
* once org is active
  * new members should be sent to welcome page where they get inducted (agree to constitution & EULA)

NOTES
* if request fails with "undefined method `members' for nil:NilClass" then delete current session/cookie
