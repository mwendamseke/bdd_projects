h1. Audit - a plugin for ActiveRecord that audits changes to ActiveRecord models

At some stage in every Rails app's history, you want an audit trail. How many of this have been created in all time? How many of that have been deleted?

This simple plugin does that, and that's all.

h2. Install

Easy!

<pre><code>./script/plugin install git://github.com/paulca/audit.git
</code></pre>

h2. Setup

You'll need to create the audits table with a migration. The indexes are for performance ... although eventually, this thing won't scale. Although you should do right by it for a good 30 million records or so.

<pre><code>
class CreateAudits < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :audits do |t|
      t.string :auditable_type
      t.integer :auditable_id
      t.string :action
      t.integer :user_id

      t.timestamps
    end
    
    add_index :audits, [:auditable_type, :action], :name => "auditable_index"
    add_index :audits, :user_id
    add_index :audits, [:user_id, :auditable_type], :name => "auditable_user_index"
    add_index :audits, [:auditable_type, :auditable_id], :name => "auditable_object"
  end

  def self.down
    remove_index :audits, :name => :auditable_object
    remove_index :audits, :name => :auditable_user_index
    remove_index :audits, :user_id
    remove_index :audits, :name => :auditable_index
    drop_table :audits
  end
end
</code></pre>

h2. Usage

<pre><code>class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  audit
end

@post = Post.new
@post.save!
@post.audits.created.count # => 1
Post.created.count # => 1

@post.title = "Hey, finger!"
@post.save!
@post.audits.updated.count # => 1
Post.updated.count # => 1

@post.destroy
Post.destroyed.count # => 1
</code></pre>

That's all folks!

h2. Bonus

If you have a 'User' model and you define User.current_user, then that will be saved to the record to record the user who took the action.
