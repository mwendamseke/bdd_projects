- for cross-domain and simplicity we'll just use JSON-P polling
- use a cookie to track vote counts and emulate real event
- provide a param to define callback
- provide a param to reset vote count

We need to be able to run the vis at Webjam on our MBP, we need to be able to authenticate via HTTP basic to the official stream (/live-stream.js).

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://votestream.webjam.com.au/mock-steam.js?callback=updateVotestream">
</script>

- mongrel serves vote count state in cookie (list of 18 vote counts)
- mongrel returns response of:

callbackFunctionName([{"name":"Elvis","code":"1","votes":"8"},...]);

Desktop clients just wanting the JS leave off the callback param.

Client API:

vs = new WebjamVotestream("callbackFunctionName");
vs.poll();
vs.stop();
vs.resetCount();
