We have had 10 (or so - I'm a modulus of an ID. RSVP's are only open for one event, right?) more RSVP's for event <%= @event.name %> since I last mailed you.

The people who have RSVP'd are:

<% @rsvps.each do |rsvp|  %>
  <%= rsvp.user.full_name %> <%= rsvp.user.email %>
<% end %>

I hope you're as excited as I am.

You're happy, busy Webjam site.
