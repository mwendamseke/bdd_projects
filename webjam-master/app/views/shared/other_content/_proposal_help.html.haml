  %p Thanks for volunteering! 
  %p Here are a few tips to make sure you can make the best of your presentation:
  %ul
    %li 3 minutes is shorter than you think; practice!
    %li Everybody loves demos. We want to see things, not just hear about them.
    %li Sometimes slideshows are unavoidable, that's okay, but try for some live components.
    %li Yes, we have internet available - ADSL speeds over wireless.
    %li We provide one Macbook Pro with 3Gb RAM for your use when presenting. If you need more RAM, Windows, or some special program, then please bring your own.
